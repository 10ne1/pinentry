PIN Entry
---------

This is a collection of simple PIN or passphrase entry dialogs which
utilize the Assuan protocol as described by the aegypten project; see
http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/ for details.

There are programs for different toolkits available.  It is
automatically detected which modules can be built, but it can also be
requested explicitely:

GUI	OPTION			 DEPENDENCIES
Curses	--enable-pinentry-curses Curses library, for example ncurses
GTK+	--enable-pinentry-gtk	 Gimp Toolkit Library, eg libgtk and libglib
KDE	--enable-pinentry-kde	 KDE, eg libqt, libkdecore and libkdeui

Some of the is taken from Robert Bihlmeyer's Quituple-Agent.  For
security reasons all internationalization has been removed as the
client is expected to tell the PIN entry the text strings to be
displayed.
