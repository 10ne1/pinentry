PIN Entry
---------

This is a collection of simple PIN or passphrase entry dialogs which
utilize the Assuan protocol as described by the aegypten project; see
http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/ for details.

There are programs for different toolkits available.  For all GUIs it
is automatically detected which modules can be built, but it can also
be requested explicitely.

GUI		OPTION			 DEPENDENCIES
Curses		--enable-pinentry-curses Curses library, for example ncurses
GTK+ V1.2	--enable-pinentry-gtk	 Gimp Toolkit Library Version 1.2
			 		 eg. libgtk-1.2 and libglib-1.2
GTK+ V2.0	--enable-pinentry-gtk2	 Gimp Toolkit Library, Version 2.0
					 eg. libgtk-x11-2.0 and libglib-2.0
Qt		--enable-pinentry-qt	 Qt, eg. libqt or libqt-mt

The GTK+ and Qt pinentries can fall back to the curses mode.  The
option to enable this is --enable-fallback-curses, but this is also
detected automatically in the same way --enable-pinentry-curses is.
The fallback to curses also works if --disable-pinentry-curses is
specified.  So to disable linking to curses completely you have to
pass --disable-fallback-curses to the configure script as well.

Examples:
* To only build the GTK+ 1.2 pinentry with curses support:
./configure --enable-pinentry-gtk --enable-fallback-curses \
	--disable-pinentry-curses --disable-pinentry-qt

* To build the Qt pinentry, and the other pinentries if they are
  supported:
./configure --enable-pinentry-qt

* To build everything that is supported (complete auto-detection):
./configure

Some of the code is taken from Robert Bihlmeyer's Quintuple-Agent.
For security reasons, all internationalization has been removed.  The
client is expected to tell the PIN entry the text strings to be
displayed.
