PIN Entry
---------

This is a collection of simple PIN or passphrase entry dialogs which
utilize the Assuan protocol as described by the aegypten project; see
http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/ for details.

There are programs for different toolkits available.  For all GUIs it
is automatically detected which modules can be built, but it can also
be requested explicitely.

GUI	OPTION			 DEPENDENCIES
Curses	--enable-pinentry-curses Curses library, for example ncurses
GTK+	--enable-pinentry-gtk	 Gimp Toolkit Library, eg libgtk and libglib
Qt	--enable-pinentry-qt	 Qt, eg libqt-mt

Some of the code is taken from Robert Bihlmeyer's Quituple-Agent.  For
security reasons, all internationalization has been removed.  The
client is expected to tell the PIN entry the text strings to be
displayed.
