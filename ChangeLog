2000-09-11  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* secret-query.c (usage): Add two missing pieces of "\n\".

	* agent.c (main): --nofork is now the default, and the option is
	deprecated. New option --fork added to turn forking on again.
	Close stdout (and stderr unless debugging) even when not forking,

	(forget_old_stuff): Would not set next_deadline correctly.
	(do_get): Implement FLAGS_INSURE.

	* client.c (main): "list" format changed so that comment is to the
	far right. Display the deadline as proper date/time, too.

	* configure.in: <getopt.h> check had redundant definition.
	* acconfig.h: Remove here, too.

	* configure.in: Check for <inttypes.h>. If not found, check for

	* 0.7 released.

	* secmem.c: ulong is not defined on all systems.

	* agent.h: <inttypes.h> should define `uint32_t' as per Unix98, so

	on size of toplevel window.
	(grab_keyboard): Removed protection against multiple calls.
	(ungrab_keyboard): New function, cancelling a keyboard grab.

	(main): Include id in xgetpass prompt.

1999-10-14  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	(store): New function, abstracted out from do_put.
	(do_put): Use it.
	(do_get): If secret was not found, and DISPLAY is set, try to
	query the user about it. If successful, store it.
	(main): Route standard file descriptors to /dev/null rather than
	just closing them. The latter would confuse children.

1999-10-13  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* gtksecentry.c, gtksecentry.h: New files, being slightly modified
	versions of GTK+'s gtkentry.[ch], spiffed up to use secure memory.

 	(log_fatal): New function, logs to stderr, and dies.

1999-09-08  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* secmem.c (log_info): New function, logs to stderr.

	* agent.c (agent): select() expects the number of fds, not the
	highest fd. So remember that number.

	* agent.c (agent): Don't use FD_SETSIZE, which is not defined on
	all systems. Remember the number of the highest descriptor
	instead.

	* configure.in: Replace getline() instead of getdelim() because
	this is the function we really need. Still check for getdelim(),
	though - there are systems out there where this is provided, but
	getline() is not.

	check" always builds all in . first.

1999-08-21  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* agent.h (reply_list_entry, reply_list): New reply structures.
	* agent.c (send_list_entry): New function.
	(do_list): First send number of entries, then each entry via
	send_list_entry().
	* agentlib.c (agent_list): Read entries returned by LIST request.
	* client.c (main): Output all entries returned by agent_list().

	issue a warning if running setuid.

	* configure.in: Run together two REPLACE_FUNCS.
	Check for seteuid.

	* client-test: Mask out insecure memory warnings.

	* agentlib.c (send_request): Let the calling functions reserve
	space for the reply, but offer a simple way for simple requests.
	(agent_get): Allocate secure memory.

	* agent.c (main): Moved secmem_init() after the fork, since that
	seemingly munlock's all pages.
	Drop priviledges just in case somebody wants to install this
	suid-root.
	Flush stdout.

	* agpg.c (find_id): Would reorder arguments.
	Initialize opt_version.
	(main): Initialize secure memory.

	* Makefile.am (agpg_SOURCES): Link with secure memory module.

	* client.c (usage): Fixed another program name reference.

1999-08-06  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* configure.in: Conditionally define HAVE_GTK.
	* acconfig.h: Add here too.

	* client.c (xgetpass): Use "secret-query" only if it was built.
	(main): Don't output secret (GET command) to ttys.

	* agpg.c (find_id): Also print own version if "--version" is given.

	Print error if exec fails.

	* agent.c (main): Added an option to produce csh-compatible
	output.

	* agent.c, client.c: Forgot the terminating NULL in long options.
	Fixed the program names in usage and version output.

	* agent.c (create_socket): AF_UNIX and PF_UNIX are Unix98, so
	that's what we use. AF_LOCAL, PF_LOCAL removed.

1999-08-05  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* 0.4 released.

	* configure.in: Bumped version.
	Check for missing getdelim.

	* cgpg: Removed, obsoleted by agpg.
	* Makefile.am: Here, too.

	* agpg.c (find_id): New function.
	(main): Use it.

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Put GTK_FLAGS and GLIB_FLAGS here. It
	is the easiest way for sources needing it, and it won't hurt those 
	that don't.
	(agent.o): Explicit command removed accordingly.

1999-08-04  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* configure.in: Need double quoting in nested AC_MSG_WARN.

	* client.c (xgetpass): If no tty is available, but a DISPLAY is,
	fork off "secure-query" to read the secret.
	Put the fgets into a loop that keeps reading until all of the
	secret is read.

	* client-test: Unset DISPLAY, so that "secret-query" is never used.

1999-08-03  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* agpg.c: New file, first cut at a C version of the gpg wrapper,

	stomach).
	* Makefile.am: Add it to built programs.
	(LDADD): New default.
	(secret_client_LDADD): Removed, since it was identical to default.

1999-08-01  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* secret-query.c: New program, queries the user for a password.
	* Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Added it.
	* configure.in: Check for GTK+, build "secret-query" only when
	that is available.

	* cgpg: Extra argument for ID is no longer necessary. cgpg will
	scan the gpg args for switches that affect user-id, and determine
	the right key itself. Per convention, the key-id is used by "GET".

	* configure.in: The project name is now "secret-agent".

	* Makefile.am: "agent" & "client" renamed to "secret-agent" &
	"secret-client", respectively.
	* client-test: Adapt to new names.

	* Thoughts: Removed discussion of other names.

	* cgpg: A space was missing.

	* i18n.h: New file, centralizing the gettext macro defs.

	* agent.c: Ditto.
	(create_socket): Replace AF_FILE, PF_FILE with AF_LOCAL, PF_LOCAL
	for portability.
	* agentlib.c (agent_init): Ditto.
