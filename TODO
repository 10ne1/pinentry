* The DISPLAY setting should be honoured by the pinentry applications
  using XFree86.  This implies reconfiguring the underlying toolkit,
  is this always possible?
  (This is not so important, as pinentry is always restarted.)

* The Qt and curses PIN entry should support enhanced mode (when it is
  implemented in gpg-agent).

* The GTK+ PIN entry needs to convert the text of the button label
  from UTF-8 to the local encoding.

* Set the max length of password globally (dynamically in protocol?).

* A heartbeat status message should be sent every few seconds, so that
  the gpg-agent is better able to cope with jammed pinentries.
