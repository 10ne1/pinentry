* The DISPLAY setting should be honoured by the pinentry applications using XFree86.
  This implies reconfiguring the underlying toolkit, is this always possible?
  (This is not so important, as pinentry is always restarted.)

* The Qt and curses PIN entry should support enhanced mode (when it is
  implemented in gpg-agent).

* The Qt PIN entry needs to use libpinentry (maybe).

* A heartbeat status message should be send every few seconds, so that
  the gpg-agent is better able to cope with jammed pinentries.
