* The Button texts are not internationalized and can't be set from the
  application.  This is supopsedly only true for the GETPIN dialog.
  (The CONFIRM dialog can take the button text from the PROMPT setting).

* The DISPLAY setting should be honoured by the pinentry applications using XFree86.
  This implies reconfiguring the underlying toolkit, is this always possible?

* The Qt and curses PIN entry need enhanced mode.

* The Qt PIN entry needs to use libpinentry (maybe).

* The curses pinentry doesn't grok \n in error message.

* No pinentry does s/+/ /.  Should they?
