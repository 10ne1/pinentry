* The DISPLAY setting should be honoured by the pinentry applications using XFree86.
  This implies reconfiguring the underlying toolkit, is this always possible?
  (This is not so important, as pinentry is always restarted.)

* The Qt and curses PIN entry should support enhanced mode (when it is
  implemented).

* The Qt PIN entry needs to use libpinentry (maybe).

* The curses pinentry doesn't grok \n in error message.
